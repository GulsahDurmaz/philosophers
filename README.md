  Solution to the Dining Philosophers problem for the 42 cursus project.
</p>

## Overview

This project provides a solution to the "Dining Philosophers" problem. Essentially, it models a situation where a group of philosophers is seated at a table. Each philosopher needs a plate of pasta and a fork. However, each philosopher sits between two forks, and two philosophers sharing the same fork cannot eat simultaneously.

## Installation
