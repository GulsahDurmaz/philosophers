  Solution to the Dining Philosophers problem for the 42 cursus project.
</p>

# <p align="center"><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  This project provides a solution to the "Dining Philosophers" problem. Essentially, it models a situation where a group of philosophers is seated at a table. Each philosopher needs a plate of pasta and a fork. However, each philosopher sits between two forks, and two philosophers sharing the same fork cannot eat simultaneously.
